Examly is an online exam portal designed to make the examination process hassle-free for both teachers and students.

With a modern and user-friendly interface, Examly provides an intuitive experience for teachers to create question papers, set answer keys, and upload them with ease. Meanwhile, students can take the exam on their respective dashboard, with their marks automatically calculated and stored. Furthermore, the platform offers detailed performance analysis, enabling students to identify their strengths and weaknesses and improve their performance over time.

As the front-end lead of the "Examly" project, I played a critical role in designing the landing page, login page, and result page from scratch. My design skills enabled me to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface that perfectly captured the essence of the project.

Working as part of a team of six members, I assisted my fellow teammates by providing guidance and support whenever needed. I helped them overcome technical challenges and contributed to the development of various other pages. My contributions also extended to integrating the front-end with the back-end and database, ensuring that the platform provides a seamless experience for users.

Overall, Examly provides an efficient and modern examination process for educational institutions and organizations. The platform's user-friendly interface and performance analysis features make it easy for students to take exams and improve their performance over time. With my experience as the front-end lead of the project, I am confident that Examly will revolutionize the online examination process, providing a seamless experience for all users.
